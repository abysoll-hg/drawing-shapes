<p><h2>Task 1</h2></p>
<p>In Task 1, I was challeged to create a shape using a for loop. In doing so, I was required to critically think about the position, size and dimensions of the shape. I ended up doing a square, not only for simplicity, but because the square had equal sides (100 units) and I drew it on the starting place.</p>
<p><h2>Task 2</h2></p>
<p>In Task 2, I was challenged to create at least 10 shapes I created in Task 1. To do so, I needed to create a nested for loop and move the shape every time so the shapes do not overlap each other fully each time and stay in the same position. Before this, however, I needed to move the cursor away from the first shape, hence why I used t.up() and t.down(), so there would be a more seamless transition between moving the turtle
